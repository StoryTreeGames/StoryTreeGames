A fully open source game engine written in rust. The idea is to create "from scratch" libraries that can create windows, render with "native" APIs, access system resources, etc...

> Note: This project is currently just a bunch of brainstorming and is only maintained by a single developer. Contributions and ideas are more than welcome. See the [issues](https://github.com/StoryTreeGames/StoryTreeGames/issues) section for discussions on what is needed, areas that need work, and how to contribute.

## Libraries
- [ ] Sys: System windowing and API access accross platforms
- [ ] Render: A rendering engine that can render graphics and UI to a cross platform window/frame
- [ ] Engine: Game engine specific structures and systems
- [ ] Scripting: Allows for scripting in multiple different languages
